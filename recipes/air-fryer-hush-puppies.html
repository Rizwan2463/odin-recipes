    <h2>Discreption:-</h2>
    <h3>Hush Puppies</h3>
    <p>Forget about deep frying, and give your hush puppies a light update using an air fryer.<br>They're just a bit denser in texture than deep frying, and look for a subtle hint of heat.<br> They're the perfect sidekick to fried fish or shrimp, but they're equally good with a drizzle of honey.</p>

        <li>1 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced green bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh spinach, stems removed and leaves torn into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>¾ cup low-fat buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Direction:-</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (198 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.<br> Line the bottom of the air fryer basket with aluminum foil and spray with nonfat cooking spray.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Stir cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, cayenne, and garlic powder<br> together in a large bowl. Mix in onion and bell pepper.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Whisk buttermilk and egg together in a separate bowl.<br>Stir into cornmeal mixture. Let mixture rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Drop cornmeal mixture into the foil-lined basket using a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop,<br>making sure not to have them touching each other. Coat with nonfat cooking spray.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer until golden brown, crispy, and cooked through,<br>9 to 10 minutes. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Notes:-</h2>
    <p>You can use any color bell pepper that you prefer.<br>Air fryers heat differently, so check occasionally for doneness.<br>If you need to cook in batches, put all hush puppies back into the fryer at the end,<br> and give them a quick reheat for 1 to 2 minutes.<br>I ended up with 12 good-size hush puppies using the 2 tablespoon cookie scoop,<br> but if you like them smaller, just be sure to adjust your cooking time.</p>
